                <h2 class="head">Luxury Cars</h2>
                <p class="text">
                    A luxury car is a car that provides above-average to high-end levels of comfort, features, and equipment.
                    Often more expensive materials and surface finishes are used, and buyers expect better build quality. 
                    The usually higher pricing and more upscale appearance is often associated with higher social status of the users, 
                    compared to low and mid-market segment cars.
                    <br><br>
                    Luxury cars have traditionally emphasized higher levels of comfort and safety. Manufacturers often introduce new safety 
                    technologies and comfort amenities on luxury models before they are available on more affordable models.
                    Some brands, like Audi and BMW have expanded their marketing by "introducing lesser priced and strip-down economy versions of their products."

                    <h2 class="desc">LAMBORGHINI</h2></div>
                    <p class="text">The Lamborghini Aventador is one of the most exotic-looking cars in the world, and its final form roars into the sunset in limited numbers with a 769-hp V-12.
                         Arguably the godfather of supercars, the Lamborghini Countach returns with a retro design, an 802-hp hybrid powertrain—and it's already sold out.
                         Lamborghini is actually a surname. More specifically it's the surname of Ferruccio Lamborghini who first began an agriculture tractor business, then a marine business before eventually opening the Lamborghini automobile company in 1963.
                         While both provide an incredibly thrilling ride, they possess specific characteristics that set them apart. Ferraris are known for their raw power and aggression, with a focus on performance, while Lamborghinis are more refined and luxurious.

                    <h2 class="desc">FERRARI</h2></div>
                    <p class="text">
                        Ferraris are what dreams are made of. Fast, sexy, and highly exclusive, these Italian supercars push the boundaries of performance and cause a stir wherever they go. The sensually styled Roma coupe is the most accessible in terms of price, but even it is far too expensive for most people.
                        Ferrari is known around the world as an iconic brand, synonymous with game-changing performance and unparalleled elegance. But before 1939, “Ferrari” meant “Enzo Ferrari,” the founder of the brand and head of the Scuderia Ferrari racing team for Alfa Romeo.
                        Another interesting Ferrari fact is that it has its own race track, called Fiorano Circuit. It is privately-owned, located close to Maranello in the town of Fiorano Modenese, and is used for the development as well as testing of Ferrari's race and road cars.
                        Ferraris are distinguished by the unique sound of their famed roar. The Ferrari engine start sound is an expression of pure joy borne from world-class engineering, the result of decades of engineering refinement to produce a throaty rumble connecting the driver to their car.

                    <h2 class="desc">MERCEDES</h2></div>
                    <p class="text">

                        The current Mercedes-Benz slogan is “The best or nothing”. This phrase helps represent what Mercedes-Benz as a brand stands for. Mercedes-Benz promises to deliver “the best or nothing” through everything they do.
                        "In concrete terms a Mercedes is characterised by three very pronounced traits: optimum ride comfort, high driving safety and tangible self-assurance.

                    <p class="text">
                        Automobiles Ettore Bugatti was a German then French manufacturer of high-performance automobiles. The company was founded in 1909 in the then-German city of Molsheim, Alsace, by the Italian-born industrial designer Ettore Bugatti. The cars were known for their design beauty and their many race victories.
                        Ettore Bugatti (1881-1947) was the legendary founder of the Bugatti company and the designer of the most successful race cars and luxurious vehicles of his day. He was one of the major pioneers of both automotive engineering and the tradition of motorsports, and remains famous to this day for his visionary designs.
                        Mayur Shree, a real-estate magnate based out of Texas in the USA, is reportedly the only Indian-origin person to own a Bugatti Chiron, according to automobile news site Cartoq.
                        The earliest Bugatti built were this tiny Type 10 prototype, built by Ettore Bugatti for himself in his spare time between 1907 and 1909, while in the employ of the Deutz company in Cologne, Germany.
